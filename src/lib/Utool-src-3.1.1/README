      http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/chorus/utool/

                          Version 3.1
                         November 2006


This package is a tool for performing various tasks that arise in the
context of scope underspecification. Among other things, it will
enumerate readings from an underspecified description and convert
between different equivalent formalisms. These conversions implement
theoretical results from the recent literature, and the enumeration
algorithm is the fastest one known today.

Utool was created within the CHORUS project of the DFG Collaborative
Research Centre (SFB) 378 "Ressource-adaptive cognitive processes" at
Saarland University in Saarbruecken, Germany. It is distributed under
the GPL (see the file COPYING in this directory).
