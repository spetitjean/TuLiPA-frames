           Calling Utool from Prolog
           -------------------------
           
This folder contains a file that will let you connect to the Utool
Server from a Prolog program.  What you will do is to consult the file
"utool-interface.pl".  This will define the predicate "utool_request",
which sends requests to Utool via a socket (as described in the Utool
manual) and parses the results. 

The Prolog Utool interface was developed and tested under Sicstus
Prolog.  We encourage you to try it under different dialects of
Prolog, assuming that you understand that it may not work as expected
due to Prolog differences.  You will need the Sicstus XML library in
this case, which you can get at
http://www.zen37763.zen.co.uk/xml.pl.html.

The Prolog interface was developed by Stefan Mueller
(Stefan.Mueller@cl.uni-bremen.de) in the context of the Trale grammar
development system and Stefan's Grammix distribution
(http://www.cl.uni-bremen.de/Software/Grammix/), and kindly provided
to Utool as a contributed package.
